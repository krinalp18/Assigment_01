# Assigment_01
I have calculated the survival rate using the implementation of the Naive Bayes and K-Nearest Neighbours algorithms from scratch in Python using Numpy and Pandas and Matplotlib for visualization.

The algorithm is be implemented as a function with arguments, x_train (the features) and y_train (the output).
